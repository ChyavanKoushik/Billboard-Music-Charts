# Billboard-Music-Charts
A web crawler in python which saves a list of all top music charts from billboard.
A simple web crawler using BS4 that retrieves artist and song titles from all charts on the billboard website and saves the charts in a text file.

I also used "auto-py-to-exe" to convert the .py file to a .exe file. Running the .exe file creates all the charts in .txt format in the same folder
